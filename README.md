nasa-spaceapps-exoplanet
Streamlit app for exoplanet classification using NASA public datasets

Overview
This project is a user-friendly, interactive web application for detecting and classifying exoplanets using machine learning and NASA data. Built as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025, it allows students, researchers, and space enthusiasts to explore exoplanet predictions, analyze large datasets from space missions, and experiment with AI/ML—all in the browser.

Features
Supports Kepler, TESS, and K2 datasets (modular, easy to add more)

Clean UI built with Streamlit

ML model training & inference (Random Forest/Logistic Regression, etc.)

Dataset selector for cross-mission analysis

Easy CSV upload – preview & map columns if needed

Results shown with class prediction and confidence scores

Model performance metrics (accuracy, cross-validation, feature importance, plots)

Hyperparameter tuning and in-app retraining (coming soon)

Built-in help, about, and documentation tabs

Powered by Python, pandas, scikit-learn, plotly, joblib

Quickstart
Clone the repo:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Yamuna-b/nasa-spaceapps-exoplanet.git
cd nasa-spaceapps-exoplanet
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare data (e.g., for Kepler):

bash
python data_preprocessing.py --dataset kepler --input data/kepler_koi.csv --output data/kepler_koi_cleaned.csv
Train model:

bash
python train_model.py --dataset kepler --input data/kepler_koi_cleaned.csv
Launch the app:

bash
streamlit run app.py
Data Sources
Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI)

TESS Objects of Interest (TOI)

K2 Planets and Candidates

Methodology
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, handling different column naming conventions.

Modeling: Train Random Forest or Logistic Regression to classify candidates as Confirmed, Candidate, or False Positive.

Evaluation: Accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance.

UI: Streamlit web app allowing dataset selection, upload, prediction, visualization.

Explainability: Results interpreted with feature plots; roadmap for SHAP/LIME explanations.
